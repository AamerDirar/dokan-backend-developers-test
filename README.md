# Dokan backend developers test
This repository contains my contribution, providing solutions for the Backend Developer test as part of my application for the Backend Developer position at Dokan. The test includes tasks designed to evaluate API design, database management, and adherence to coding best practices.

## Overview
This project is a simple API for a blogging platform built with **Laravel 12**.  
It demonstrates API design, Eloquent relationships, authentication, authorization, validation, and testing.


## Objective
Build a RESTful API for managing blog posts, comments, and categories, with proper authentication, authorization, and feature testing.

## Goal

The goal of this documentation is not only to demonstrate functional correctness but also to highlight a production-ready mindset through the use of clean code principles, test-driven development, modular design, and effective use of the Laravel framework.

Covered areas include:

Architecture & Design Decisions
Rationale behind service abstraction, responsibility separation, and data flow.

Data Handling & Synchronization
Techniques for robust import workflows, soft deletion handling, and external API sync strategies.

Code Quality & Standards
Adherence to SOLID principles, naming conventions, and Laravel best practices.

Testing Strategy
Comprehensive unit and feature test coverage using Pest, including mock usage, edge cases, and scheduled task verification.

Error Handling & Resilience
Graceful handling of malformed data, external dependencies, and logging strategies for observability.
